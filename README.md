## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The repositories listed on my profile are not a complete list of my projects, see also:
- [Factorio Mods](https://github.com/Darcys-Factorio-Mods)
- [Forks](https://github.com/Darcys-Forks)

Github gists aren't convenient to access, so mine are [here](https://gist.github.com/DarcyManoel).<br>
For a breakdown list of my gists by category, go [here](https://github.com/DarcyManoel/gists).
